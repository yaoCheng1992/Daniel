> “I was going to make him a better person. He would grovel and come back to me. He would always promise he would never hit me again. It was all lies. I fell for it.”

> When she would try to break off their relationship, Anj would notice him pop up “everywhere I was” in town. 
>
> The teenager was bedridden and non-verbal for years. 
>
> “The slaps got harder, then they turned into punches,” she recalled.

> Meanwhile, her attacker was sentenced to the minimum jail term of seven-and-a-half years — a punishment Anj describes as “bull sh*t”.
>
> “I hope he rots in the depths of hell for all eternity.”
